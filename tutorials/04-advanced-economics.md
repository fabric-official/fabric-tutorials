Advanced Economics in Fabric
Fabric 1.0 introduces a self-sustaining agent economy, ensuring developers earn royalties perpetually and the DAO treasury funds ecosystem growth.
This tutorial covers:
Royalty streaming
DAO treasury funding
XP and multiplier system
Developer revenue strategies
💰 Step 1: Royalty Streaming
Every agent in Fabric includes a policy-enforced payout split:
80% → Developer
20% → DAO Treasury
Example .fab policy:
policy {
  payout_split 80% developer, 20% dao
}
Whenever an agent is used or forked, royalties automatically stream to:
Developer wallet (80%)
DAO treasury (20%)
Check your accrued royalties:
fab claim
Output:
Claiming royalties...
80% sent to 0xDevWallet
20% routed to DAO treasury
Total: 25 FAB claimed
🏛️ Step 2: DAO Treasury Funding
The DAO treasury uses its 20% royalty share to:
Fund developer bounties
Launch certification programs
Invest in ecosystem tools and tutorials
Reward governance participants
View DAO treasury balance:
fab dao treasury status
Output:
DAO Treasury Balance: 10,250 FAB
Active Proposals: 4
🧠 Step 3: XP and Multiplier System
Developers earn XP (Experience Points) for:
Creating agents
Receiving forks
Participating in DAO proposals
XP boosts future royalty earnings via a multiplier:
Base multiplier: 1.0x
XP multiplier: Increases every 100 XP
Check your XP:
fab xp status
Output:
Developer XP: 450
Royalty Multiplier: 1.45x
💼 Step 4: Developer Revenue Strategy
To maximize long-term income:
Publish forkable agents → more forks = more royalties
Engage in DAO governance → earn XP and treasury rewards
Contribute to tutorials and SDKs → bounty payouts
Certify agents → gain enterprise adoption with premium rewards
🔐 Economic Security
All royalty streams are on-chain
Immutable audit trails prevent manipulation
DAO-controlled treasury ensures community-driven spending
