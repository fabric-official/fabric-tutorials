DAO Governance

Fabric 1.0 is governed entirely through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), ensuring that no centralized entity controls the platform.
This tutorial walks you through:
Submitting proposals
Discussing governance changes
Voting on-chain
Claiming DAO rewards

📝 Step 1: Prepare a DAO Proposal
DAO proposals are written in YAML format and stored under proposals/.
Example: DAO-001.yaml
id: DAO-001
title: "Increase XP Multiplier for Early Developers"
summary: "Proposal to boost early adopter rewards by increasing XP multiplier to 2x for the first 6 months."
impact:
  - Encourages early agent creation
  - Accelerates swarm adoption
  - Strengthens DAO treasury funding

🚀 Step 2: Submit Proposal
Submit a proposal using the Fabric CLI:
fab dao submit --proposal proposals/DAO-001.yaml
Output:
[✔] DAO proposal submitted successfully
Proposal ID: DAO-001
Discussion: https://github.com/fabric-official/fabric-dao-forum/discussions/5

💬 Step 3: Join Discussion
Visit the link created in DAO Forum Discussions
Debate and refine the proposal with community feedback
Transparent governance discussions ensure long-term stability

🗳️ Step 4: Vote On-Chain
Once ready for voting:
fab dao vote --proposal DAO-001 --choice yes
or:
fab dao vote --proposal DAO-001 --choice no
Output:
[✔] Your vote has been cast
Current Tally: 72% YES / 28% NO

💰 Step 5: Claim DAO Rewards
DAO voters and active participants earn rewards:
fab dao claim
Output:
Claiming DAO governance rewards...
Reward Claimed: 50 FAB
XP Added: 30
